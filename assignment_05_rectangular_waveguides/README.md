# ELG3106 — Assignment 5: Modes in Rectangular Waveguides (Fall 2025)

This folder contains my work for **ELG3106 (Electromagnetic Engineering) — Assignment 5**, focused on how **TE and TM modes** propagate in an **air-filled rectangular waveguide**, including cutoff behavior, dispersion, field distributions, and power flow.

## What this assignment covers
- Identifying **which waveguide modes propagate** below a specified frequency limit by comparing cutoff frequencies
- Generating and interpreting **dispersion curves** (how propagation changes with frequency for each mode)
- Verifying the **dominant mode (TE10)** through simulated field patterns and power flow
- Comparing **degenerate mode pairs** (modes with the same cutoff behavior but different field structures)

## What’s included
- **Report (PDF):** Full write-up with methodology, results, and discussion 
- **Flow diagram:** End-to-end workflow for mode selection, cutoff grouping, and dispersion plotting
- **Code:** Script used to compute cutoff frequencies, group degenerate modes, and generate dispersion plots 
- **Virtual simulations:** Screenshots from the **Module 8.5 Rectangular Waveguide tool** showing dispersion results, field maps, and power-density plots
- **Results + discussion:** Interpretation of cutoff behavior, dominant-mode characteristics, and why degenerate modes share dispersion but not identical field/power patterns
