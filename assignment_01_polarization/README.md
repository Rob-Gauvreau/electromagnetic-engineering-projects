This folder contains my work for **ELG3106 (Electromagnetic Engineering) — Assignment 1**, which focuses on **electromagnetic wave polarization** and how different parameter choices change the resulting polarization state.

## What this assignment covers
- Interpreting polarization using the **polarization ellipse** (orientation, ellipticity, and handedness)
- Mapping different polarization angle combinations to consistent field parameters
- Verifying computed results using a **polarization visualization tool** and documenting outcomes

## What’s included
- **Report (PDF):** Full write-up with workflow, results, and discussion
- **Flow diagram:** A clear process overview of how the parameter table was generated
- **Code:** Script used to compute and tabulate polarization parameters for multiple cases
- **Simulation snapshots:** Visual verification examples from the polarization tool
- **Results + discussion:** Summary of patterns observed (e.g., how changing angles affects polarization type and handedness)
