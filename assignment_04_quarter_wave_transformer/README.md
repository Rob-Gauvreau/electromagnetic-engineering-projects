# ELG3106 — Assignment 4: Quarter-Wave Transformer Matching (Fall 2025)

This folder contains my work for **ELG3106 (Electromagnetic Engineering) — Assignment 4**, focused on designing a **quarter-wave transformer matching network** to match a complex load to a 50 Ω line and eliminate reflections. 

## What this assignment covers
- Matching a complex load by first transforming it to a **purely real impedance** at specific locations along the line
- Designing a **quarter-wave transformer** to achieve a match to the feedline
- Identifying **two valid matching solutions** (different placement/transformer impedance choices)
- Verifying the design using **Smith chart construction** and the **Module 2.7 tutorial/design app**

## What’s included
- **Report (PDF):** Full write-up including workflow, results, and discussion :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Algorithm / flow:** Step-by-step approach (normalize → rotate to real axis → compute matching section → verify)
- **Smith chart work:** Annotated chart showing both solutions
- **Virtual simulations:** Screenshots and output data confirming near-zero reflection (minor mismatch comes from rounding)
- **Results + discussion:** Interpretation of why two solutions exist and how the transformer achieves the match
