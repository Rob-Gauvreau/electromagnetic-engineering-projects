# ELG3106 — Assignment 2: Reflection & Transmission at Oblique Incidence (Fall 2025)

This folder contains my work for **ELG3106 (Electromagnetic Engineering) — Assignment 2**, focused on how a uniform plane wave reflects and transmits at **oblique incidence** across a planar dielectric boundary.

## What this assignment covers
- Comparing **TE vs TM** behavior at an interface by sweeping the incident angle
- Plotting and interpreting **reflectivity and transmissivity** trends across angle
- Identifying and confirming **Brewster’s angle** (TM-only for non-magnetic dielectrics)
- Solving for **incident, reflected, and transmitted phasors** for a specified case and validating with simulation

## What’s included
- **Report (PDF):** Full write-up with workflow, results, and discussion
- **Flow diagram:** Overview of the computation pipeline (constants → functions → plots)
- **Code:** Script used to compute coefficients, generate plots, and tabulate outputs
- **Virtual simulation screenshots:** Visual checks for field components and coefficient behavior
- **Results + discussion:** Key observations (angle-dependent trends, Brewster angle confirmation, energy consistency)
